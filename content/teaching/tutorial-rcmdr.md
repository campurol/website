### Follow the videos to install "R" and "R Commander" in either Mac or Windows. 

Note: The installation of R is equivalent to most softwares and should not involve anything unusual. The installation of R Commander ("Rcmdr") implies using the R command promp, which given your setup, might imply getting asked different things during its installation. This means getting asked to install extra packages (as you will see in the windows video) or to choose different source servers. 

If you are having trouble installing Rcmdr, you can check [the author's website](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/installation-notes.html). You can also post comments in the videos to ask questions or help others.

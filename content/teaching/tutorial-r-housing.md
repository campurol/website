### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!
Welcome to the companion website of the R Tutorial. This website includes the tutorial R-Markdown files that runs an hedonic analysis on house prices using transaction data.
 
### Why R?
- ðŸ‘‰ Itâ€™s one of the most popular tools used for data analysis
- It can handle large amounts of data (unlimited!)
- It's perfect for unstructured data (Twitter, Facebook, News, Reedit, Linkedin, IMBD, etc)
- It makes some of the best pictures in the business
- It records every step of your analysis (easier **replicability**!)
- It has a huge online community of users/supporters

### What will we do in the tutorial?
We will get an introduction to R by following the steps recommended by the book "R for Data Science" (reference below). 
These are basic steps that anyone wishing to embark in a data analysis project should follow:
- **Import** (from a file, a database, a website, etc)
- **Tidy** (mainly clean and make it consistent)
- **Understand**: Transform -> Visualize -> Model -> Repeat ... (Graphs, Statistical Models, Machine Learning, etc)
- **Communicate**

### What should I do before the tutorial?
You can get ready for the tutorial by either
{{% callout note %}}
- Installing [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) in your own computer
- Or Signing-up in [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) before the tutorial. It's free. It's easy. It's in the cloud. If you want, you can log in, create a project and start playing with RStudio. 
- Then, the day of the tutorial (or before if you have the time). Please login into your RStudio Cloud account, create a project and upload the tutorial files to your new project.
